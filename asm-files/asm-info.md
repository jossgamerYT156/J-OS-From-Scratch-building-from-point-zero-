## -Some ASM files will be here.
ASM files are the ones containing the code for J-OS,
note that these will be one or two versions outdated thanks to some
protections against new features and implementations

## -HOW TO BUILD!

# run:

```nasm -o [name_of_the_file].bin [name_of_the_file].asm```

then run the same command for building the rest fo the files inside J-OS.
