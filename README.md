# J-OS-From-Scratch-building-from-point-zero-
this repo is a Open Source project where i will try to create a Operative System From Sratch! (OSFS)
i will learn a lot, and i hope you do as well!! we are just try to make a basic OS with a shell
then i will move to do a basic GUI
and if everything goes well i will configure the Networking and add apps i will write!!

This project was inspired by @Techlm77 and it´s work on LFS!!
i thought it would be nice if i just made a whole new OS for low specs Laptops or Desktop PCs!!

now you may be wondering ¿do you know what are you doing? the short answer is NO.
yet that never stopped me before from creating a new project and at least attempt to do my best!

¿what i plan to add to J-OS_OSFS?

shell commands: I want to control the whole OS from the shell, like LFS yet i would prefer to do it my way!

Shell interface: Obviously! i cannot use commands if there´s no shell interface!

Basic Text-Based apps: just some basic apps to know my OS is working, things like Vim or Nano, yet i want to do it more user friendly for those who aren´t used to the idea of a shell interface!.

some games?: maybe if i can get to know my own OS i will try to do some simple games for entretainement.

Some GUI(???): i am still not sure if i want to add a GUI since these are very time consuming and could be demanding for some devices since they are, well... graphical, i want to keep it simple and clean, nothing windows-like that will crash your PC or just forget where to put the updates!

Simplicity of configurations: we all know that some DEs are very complex... some even could be categorized as "High level"... so i want to keep mine as close to a clean and simple OS so people don´t get all confused!!

Portability: i want it to be portable, this will take some time and research to be able to use it properly, some DEs are very high on storage usage, like Windows UI or KDE Plasma, so i want to make my own DE that is light and portable, as well i want to keep the OS as more compressed as i can, so even the lowest specs laptops can run it!!

accesibility: i know most of people don´t speak english or spanish, so i will work into making traductions for every version of the OS, note that this will take time and maybe will look bad since i am no polyglot or know a lot of lenguages, i will use the classic google translate and a bit of time!

NOTES!!!
this project for now will be mantained by me, since it is a bit challenging i cannot say it will take me 1 or 2 weeks, i know i will take a lot of time so i please ask you all to be patient and understand i am still a newbie, if you see bugs or errors that could be fatal, let me know, i would be happy to correct them and make them less problematic, even erradicate errors or security flaws!!
this project aims for newbies on the whole OS topic, yet you will have to use the shell a lot, but don´t worry!!
i will make sure to make a simple Help command for all those who are a bit lost by the whole shell topic!

¿What to expect?
i am still not sure of what you should expect, i will be active a lot and then don´t publish for weeks, since i have a lot more projects in the background this will maybe take a REEEEALY long time... so please, be patient

¿what are the rules of this J-OS_OSFS project´s comunity?

1.- be kind and helpful: we all were newbies once, don´t be a meanie just because someone is new using J-OS_OSFS!

2.- report bugs you find: bugs are annoying, and when too many are on the same place they become a burden, so please let me know if you find a new glitch or bug, i would really appreciate it!

3.- don´t harrass!!: people have a private life that they don´t want others to know, so do you, keep other´s life´s in private and don´t harrass or doxx others, we aim for a kind comunity and a useful one, not a lot of trolls doxxing and harrasing others!

4.- if you improve it, share it!: we all love improvements! i am not asking for you to give me all the credit, i love seeing other´s work! and i would love to see some users improving their own distros, i just ask you to share your improvements and how to do it!
and if you can share install scripts that works on J-OS_OSFS it would be amazing!!
we would appreciate it!

5.- be kind and respectful!: we will probably have people of all ethnicity, religion, nacionality, sexuality and more, so don´t say slurs or threat others differently just for who they are, we all are special and amazing at our own way!! <3

6.- do NOT mess with the developers and contribuitors!!: we all work very hard to give you a functional OS, we at least would like a bit of respect or love for our work <3

¿who are you?
I am Joss! also known as Lilly Dev
i am a newbie dev, i love coding and music, normally i spend so much time in front on my laptop so i have studied this without knowing :|
i have been coding since i was 12, in that time i were coding in a JS IDE for android devices which introduced me into this amazing world of oportunities!

¿you got projects before this or any hability on Assembly, C or C++?
not much, that´s why i would appreciate your feedback and debug about this exciting project!

¿will this run on my PC?
i am not sure, i need to code everything by hand either way, if i can help you set it up, i will, or if not i will redirect you to a developer who actually know what it´s doing!

¿why would i use J-OS_OSFS?
i really don´t have reasons why you should... but i have an idea that, you are reading this, because it catched your attention :)

¿when will the first build will be availible?
i am not sure, that could take days, weeks, months or even years, yet i will try to hurry and launch the first alpha version of J-OS_OSFS as soon as i can, keep in mind i want to share a usable and as bug free OS as i can!

¿why not using LFS?
it is a bit complex, and also i didn´t get to know as much about the OS as i would´ve liked to, so i thought this would be better!

thanks you very much for reaading, i hope you a great day, keep an eye on the "Releases" tab, since it could be active at any point of the developement!!
